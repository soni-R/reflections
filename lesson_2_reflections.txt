1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	when we initialize a repository using git init, this will create a new git repository, we will get
	.git folder into the newly created repository. it is important because git can maintain versions of 
	files and to track the files status or to check the commits.


2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Working directory is a place where all files of project are present.
	Staging area is an intermediate area between working directory and repository where we have control
	over which files to add and then commit. Staging area will contain only the files we added.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
